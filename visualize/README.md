# gephi

Download [gephi](https://gephi.github.io/). [If not working on Mac OS X 10.9](https://github.com/gephi/gephi/issues/748#issuecomment-42905181).

Import `academia-ri-nodes.csv` and `academia-ri-nodes.csv` into gephi. Choose `Force Atlas` layout.

## Network modularity

gephi can divide nodes onto groups (modules) based on Network Modularity. Every module include nodes densely connected between each other. Modules are sparsely connected between each other.

We can see that there's 2 big groups in the system: Computer Science (which includes 25% of all nodes) and Education (which includes 18% of all nodes).

### Computer Science

[![Computer Science](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreychernih/puzzles/master/visualize/images/cs.png)](https://github.com/andreychernih/puzzles/raw/master/visualize/images/cs.pdf)

Notes:
* Connected densely with `Physics`, and more surprisingly - `Chemistry`, `Biology`, `Ecology` and `Environment Sustainability` areas

### Education

### Archaeology and Architecture

Notes:
* `Design` sub-cluster

### Communication

### Marketing, Management, Finance

### Psychology

[![Psychology](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreychernih/puzzles/master/visualize/images/psychology.png)](https://github.com/andreychernih/puzzles/raw/master/visualize/images/psychology.pdf)

Notes:
* Health / Medicine is also attached here. Probably did not have enough related nodes / connections in data-set

### Languages

[![Psychology](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreychernih/puzzles/master/visualize/images/languages.png)](https://github.com/andreychernih/puzzles/raw/master/visualize/images/languages.pdf)

### Human rights

### Non-English names

[![Psychology](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreychernih/puzzles/master/visualize/images/non_english_names.png)](https://github.com/andreychernih/puzzles/raw/master/visualize/images/non_english_names.pdf)

Notes: probably they should be merged with the English counterparts
